## 🔄 Process Flow 🔁  

Here’s how **RealityCheck AI** works:  

1️⃣ User sees a post in their feed.  
2️⃣ **Redis Cache** checks if it was already analyzed.  
3️⃣ If new → **Gemini LLM** performs context-aware fact-checking.  
4️⃣ **Python Web Scraper** pulls real-time data from trusted portals (WHO, news, govt).  
5️⃣ **Supabase Vector Store** matches with historical misinformation cases.  
6️⃣ Output generated:  
   - ✅ Verified True  
   - ⚠️ Misleading/False  
   - ❗ Needs Caution  
7️⃣ User gets **explanation + educational note** ✨
